# convertible_bond_pricing 

A complete convertible bond pricing project based on Monte Carlo simulation. 

This is a preliminary research on asset pricing during my summer intership at China Universal Asset Management (CUAM, 汇添富基金管理股份有限公司). 

I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Chen Can (Researcher, CUAM), Dr. Zhang Qilong (CEO, 9M Technologies), Mr. Yan Guanlin (Pricing Researcher, CMB) and Ricequant Tech. (For data support).
